## TurtleBot 2e

<img id="largeRobot" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/turtlebot2e.png" alt="TurtleBot 2e" width="250px"/>

The TurtleBot 2e is a new revision of the TurtleBot primarily defined by replacing the netbook with a single board computer
such as the 96 Boards CE computer, the DB410c.

Documentation of the TurtleBot2e can be found on github at [turtlebot/turtlebot2e]( https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot2e) and you can get it in pdf format [here](https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot2e/releases/download/0.0.1/turtlebot2e.pdf).

Dabit Industries is offering the [TurtleBot2e](http://dabit.industries/collections/frontpage/products/turtlebot-2e) and the [TurtleBot2e Accessory Kit](http://dabit.industries/products/turtlebot-2e-sbc-accessories-kit).

## TurtleBot 2i

<img id="largeRobot" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/turtlebot2i.jpg" alt="TurtleBot 2i" width="250px"/>

The TurtleBot 2i extends upon previous iterations of the TurtleBot with a  modular chassis and for the first time, native support of robotic arms. The TurtleBot 2i offers the Pincher MK3 4 DOF Robotic Arm as a fully supported standard option allowing the robot to interact with small objects in the real world, effectively transforming the TurtleBot into an extremely capable mobile manipulator.

The TurtleBot 2i is [available](http://www.trossenrobotics.com/interbotix-turtlebot-2i-mobile-ros-platform.aspx) from Trossen Robotics.
