### Description
This book is a ROS robot programming guide based on the experiences we had accumulated from ROS projects like TurtleBot3, OpenCR and OpenManipulator. We tried to make this a comprehensive guide that covers all aspects necessary for a beginner in ROS. Topics such as embedded system, mobile robots, and robot arms programmed with ROS are included. For those who are new to ROS, there are footnotes throughout the book providing more information on the web. Through this book, we hope that more people will be aware of and participate in bringing forward the ever-accelerating collective knowledge of Robotics Engineering.

### This Handbook is written for
College students and graduate students who want to learn robot programming based on ROS (Robot Operating system) and also for professional researchers and engineers who work on robot development or software programming. We have tried to offer detailed information we learned while working on TurtleBot3 and OpenManipulator. We hope this book will be the complete handbook for beginners in ROS and more people will contribute to the ever-growing community of open robotics.

### What you will learn from this book
From the basic concept to practical robot application programming!
- ROS Kinetic Kame : Basic concept, instructions and tools
- How to use sensor and actuator packages on ROS
- Embedded board for ROS : OpenCR1.0
- SLAM & Navigation with TurtleBot3
- How to program a delivery robot using ROS Java
- OpenManipulator simulation using MoveIt! and Gazebo

# TurtleBot 2

## Build a TurtleBot 2

<img title="TurtleBot 2" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/turtlebot_2_lg.png" alt="TurtleBot 2" style="width:20%; max-width:1042px; float: right;" />

The complete TurtleBot 2 includes a Kobuki base, Microsoft XBOX Kinect, ROS compatible netbook, and factory calibrated gyro.

## Build a TurtleBot 2 from Scratch

You can build a TurtleBot from scratch by purchasing the parts such as netbook, Kinect, and Kobuki separately and following the documentation.

[Download TurtleBot Documentation](http://download.ros.org/downloads/turtlebot/tb2_hardware_docs.tar.gz)

## Kits for TurtleBot 2

There are several kits avaliable to create a Turtlebot. Check out the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/partners">distributors' website</a> to find out more.

## TurtleBot 2e

The TurtleBot 2e is a new revision of the TurtleBot primarily defined by replacing the netbook with a single board computer such as the 96 Boards CE computer, the DB410c.

Documentation of the TurtleBot2e can be found on github at [turtlebot/turtlebot2e]( https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot2e) and you can get it in pdf format [here](https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot2e/releases/download/0.0.1/turtlebot2e.pdf).

Dabit Industries is offering the [TurtleBot2e](http://dabit.industries/collections/frontpage/products/turtlebot-2e) and the [TurtleBot2e Accessory Kit](http://dabit.industries/products/turtlebot-2e-sbc-accessories-kit).
