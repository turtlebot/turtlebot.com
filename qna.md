# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is Open Source Hardware?

Open source hardware is an emerging concept. We're following the recently established [Open Source Hardware Statement of Principles and Definition v1.0](http://freedomdefined.org/OSHW). From that document:

    "Open source hardware is hardware whose design is made publicly available so that anyone can study, modify, distribute, make, and sell the design or hardware based on that design. The hardware's source, the design from which it is made, is available in the preferred format for making modifications to it....Open source hardware gives people the freedom to control their technology while sharing knowledge and encouraging commerce through the open exchange of designs."

## What does Open Source mean for TurtleBot?
We're publishing all the information that you need to build your own TurtleBot, including links to all the parts that you need. You're free (and encouraged) to modify our initial design to create your own variations on TurtleBot.

## What is turtlebot.com?
This site is a resource created by and for the TurtleBot community. It's a portal for people to learn about TurtleBot, order components to build TurtleBots, and freely exchange information about how to make, modify, and extend TurtleBots.

## Why did Willow Garage make the TurtleBot Open Source?
TurtleBot is about getting hackers involved in robotics. And hackers want maximum control over their hardware and software. Given the plans, parts list, assembly instructions, and links to suppliers, you have the ability to do whatever you want with TurtleBot. You can use components that you already have, substitute similar components, and generally mix and match to order only what you need to build exactly what you want. Of course, any component changes may entail other, as-yet-undocumented modifications to the design. Over time the community will contribute to a common body of documentation on their own TurtleBot variations, at turtlebot.com.

## I'd like to supply parts for TurtleBots; how can I participate?
Great! More suppliers of TurtleBot parts means more choice for the TurtleBot community. Please visit [this page]({{ site.baseurl }}/partners).

## What license will be applied to the TurtleBot documentation?
Just as for <a class="http" href="http://www.ros.org/wiki/DevelopersGuide#Licensing">ROS software</a>, we prefer permissive licenses that facilitate commercial use of code. The preferred license for TurtleBot hardware documentation is the [FreeBSD Documentation License](http://www.freebsd.org/copyright/freebsd-doc-license.html).

## Can I apply the TurtleBot name to my modification of your design, or my own similar robot design?
The Open Source Robotics Foundation holds the TurtleBot trademark with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. If you want to use the TurtleBot name or mark, please send an email to <mailto:turtlebot@osrfoundation.org>.

## Books
![](/assets/images/ros_robot_programming.png)

### Description
This book is a ROS robot programming guide based on the experiences we had accumulated from ROS projects like TurtleBot3, OpenCR and OpenManipulator. We tried to make this a comprehensive guide that covers all aspects necessary for a beginner in ROS. Topics such as embedded system, mobile robots, and robot arms programmed with ROS are included. For those who are new to ROS, there are footnotes throughout the book providing more information on the web. Through this book, we hope that more people will be aware of and participate in bringing forward the ever-accelerating collective knowledge of Robotics Engineering.

### This Handbook is written for
College students and graduate students who want to learn robot programming based on ROS (Robot Operating system) and also for professional researchers and engineers who work on robot development or software programming. We have tried to offer detailed information we learned while working on TurtleBot3 and OpenManipulator. We hope this book will be the complete handbook for beginners in ROS and more people will contribute to the ever-growing community of open robotics.

### What you will learn from this book
From the basic concept to practical robot application programming!
- ROS Kinetic Kame : Basic concept, instructions and tools
- How to use sensor and actuator packages on ROS
- Embedded board for ROS : OpenCR1.0
- SLAM & Navigation with TurtleBot3
- How to program a delivery robot using ROS Java
- OpenManipulator simulation using MoveIt! and Gazebo
